# Decentralized Petition Platform using Blockchain

## Project Details

Our Decentralized Petition Application allows users to make petitions that can help gather support for their cause or initiative. The app also allows these users to sign these petitions, and see who else has signed each petition.

Petitions these days might get spam signatures, some even getting raided by bots, so the results of a petition might not accurately reflect the actual authenticity of the support it gets. A decentralized petition platform allows only legitimate users to sign a petition, and be able to see who else signs. Also, a significant feature in this application is the ability for the owner of the contract to add a pool of accounts that can then be assigned to a user when on registers. This limits the number of accounts that are able to sign and make petitions and solves the issue of spam signatures and bots.

The application features a contract written in solidity. This contract is then migrated on a local Ganache blockchain using Truffle. The application itself is made using React JS.
